Getting Started with Bioconductor 3.20
======================================

To update to or install Bioconductor 3.20

1. Install R 4.4. Bioconductor 3.20 has been designed expressly for
   this version of R.

2. Follow the instructions at
   [Installing Bioconductor](/install/).


New Software Packages
=====================

There are 54 new software packages in this release of Bioconductor.

- [ADAPT](/packages/ADAPT) ADAPT carries out differential abundance
  analysis for microbiome metagenomics data in phyloseq format. It
  has two innovations. One is to treat zero counts as left censored
  and use Tobit models for log count ratios. The other is an
  innovative way to find non-differentially abundant taxa as
  reference, then use the reference taxa to find the differentially
  abundant ones.

- [AnVILAz](/packages/AnVILAz) The AnVIL is a cloud computing
  resource developed in part by the National Human Genome Research
  Institute. The AnVILAz package supports end-users and developers
  using the AnVIL platform in the Azure cloud. The package provides a
  programmatic interface to AnVIL resources, including workspaces,
  notebooks, tables, and workflows. The package also provides
  utilities for managing resources, including copying files to and
  from Azure Blob Storage, and creating shared access signatures
  (SAS) for secure access to Azure resources.

- [AnVILBase](/packages/AnVILBase) Provides generic functions for
  interacting with the AnVIL ecosystem. Packages that use either GCP
  or Azure in AnVIL are built on top of AnVILBase. Extension packages
  will provide methods for interacting with other cloud providers.

- [AnVILGCP](/packages/AnVILGCP) The package provides a set of
  functions to interact with the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) services
  on the AnVIL platform. The package is designed to work with the
  AnVIL package. User-level interaction with this package should be
  minimal.

- [assorthead](/packages/assorthead) Vendors an assortment of useful
  header-only C++ libraries. Bioconductor packages can use these
  libraries in their own C++ code by LinkingTo this package without
  introducing any additional dependencies. The use of a central
  repository avoids duplicate vendoring of libraries across multiple
  R packages, and enables better coordination of version updates
  across cohorts of interdependent C++ libraries.

- [BioGA](/packages/BioGA) Genetic algorithm are a class of
  optimization algorithms inspired by the process of natural
  selection and genetics. This package allows users to analyze and
  optimize high throughput genomic data using genetic algorithms.
  The functions provided are implemented in C++ for improved speed
  and efficiency, with an easy-to-use interface for use within R.

- [broadSeq](/packages/broadSeq) This package helps user to do easily
  RNA-seq data analysis with multiple methods (usually which needs
  many different input formats). Here the user will provid the
  expression data as a SummarizedExperiment object and will get
  results from different methods. It will help user to quickly
  evaluate different methods.

- [CatsCradle](/packages/CatsCradle) This package addresses two broad
  areas.  It allows for in-depth analysis of spatial transcriptomic
  data by identifying tissue neighbourhoods.  These are contiguous
  regions of tissue surrounding individual cells.  'CatsCradle'
  allows for the categorisation of neighbourhoods by the cell types
  contained in them and the genes expressed in them.  In particular,
  it produces Seurat objects whose individual elements are
  neighbourhoods rather than cells.  In addition, it enables the
  categorisation and annotation of genes by producing Seurat objects
  whose elements are genes.

- [CleanUpRNAseq](/packages/CleanUpRNAseq) RNA-seq data generated by
  some library preparation methods, such as rRNA-depletion-based
  method and the SMART-seq method, might be contaminated by genomic
  DNA (gDNA), if DNase I disgestion is not performed properly during
  RNA preparation. CleanUpRNAseq is developed to check if RNA-seq
  data is suffered from gDNA contamination. If so, it can perform
  correction for gDNA contamination and reduce false discovery rate
  of differentially expressed genes.

- [DeepTarget](/packages/DeepTarget) This package predicts a drug’s
  primary target(s) or secondary target(s) by integrating large-scale
  genetic and drug screens from the Cancer Dependency Map project run
  by the Broad Institute. It further investigates whether the drug
  specifically targets the wild-type or mutated target forms. To show
  how to use this package in practice, we provided sample data along
  with step-by-step example.

- [DFplyr](/packages/DFplyr) Provides `dplyr` verbs (`mutate`,
  `select`, `filter`, etc...) supporting `S4Vectors::DataFrame`
  objects. Importantly, this is achieved without conversion to an
  intermediate `tibble`. Adds grouping infrastructure to `DataFrame`
  which is respected by the transformation verbs.

- [dominoSignal](/packages/dominoSignal) dominoSignal is a package
  developed to analyze cell signaling through ligand - receptor -
  transcription factor networks in scRNAseq data. It takes as input
  information transcriptomic data, requiring counts, z-scored counts,
  and cluster labels, as well as information on transcription factor
  activation (such as from SCENIC) and a database of ligand and
  receptor pairings (such as from CellPhoneDB). This package creates
  an object storing ligand - receptor - transcription factor linkages
  by cluster and provides several methods for exploring, summarizing,
  and visualizing the analysis.

- [DuplexDiscovereR](/packages/DuplexDiscovereR) DuplexDiscovereR is
  a package designed for analyzing data from RNA cross-linking and
  proximity ligation protocols such as SPLASH, PARIS, LIGR-seq, and
  others. DuplexDiscovereR accepts input in the form of chimerically
  or split-aligned reads. It includes procedures for alignment
  classification, filtering, and efficient clustering of individual
  chimeric reads into duplex groups (DGs). Once DGs are identified,
  the package predicts RNA duplex formation and their hybridization
  energies. Additional metrics, such as p-values for random ligation
  hypothesis or mean DG alignment scores, can be calculated to rank
  final set of RNA duplexes. Data from multiple experiments or
  replicates can be processed separately and further compared to
  check the reproducibility of the experimental method.

- [EnrichDO](/packages/EnrichDO) To implement disease ontology (DO)
  enrichment analysis, this package is designed and presents a double
  weighted model based on the latest annotations of the human genome
  with DO terms, by integrating the DO graph topology on a global
  scale. This package exhibits high accuracy that it can identify
  more specific DO terms, which alleviates the over enriched problem.
  The package includes various statistical models and visualization
  schemes for discovering the associations between genes and diseases
  from biological big data.

- [EpipwR](/packages/EpipwR) A quasi-simulation based approach to
  performing power analysis for EWAS (Epigenome-wide association
  studies) with continuous or binary outcomes. 'EpipwR' relies on
  empirical EWAS datasets to determine power at specific sample sizes
  while keeping computational cost low. EpipwR can be run with a
  variety of standard statistical tests, controlling for either a
  false discovery rate or a family-wise type I error rate.

- [funOmics](/packages/funOmics) The 'funOmics' package ggregates or
  summarizes omics data into higher level functional representations
  such as GO terms gene sets or KEGG metabolic pathways. The
  aggregated data matrix represents functional activity scores that
  facilitate the analysis of functional molecular sets while allowing
  to reduce dimensionality and provide easier and faster biological
  interpretations. Coordinated functional activity scores can be as
  informative as single molecules!

- [geomeTriD](/packages/geomeTriD) geomeTriD (Three Dimensional
  Geometry Package) create interactive 3D plots using the GL library
  with the 'three.js' visualization library (https://threejs.org) or
  the rgl library. In addition to creating interactive 3D plots, the
  application also generates simplified models in 2D. These 2D models
  provide a more straightforward visual representation, making it
  easier to analyze and interpret the data quickly. This
  functionality ensures that users have access to both detailed
  three-dimensional visualizations and more accessible
  two-dimensional views, catering to various analytical needs.

- [ggseqalign](/packages/ggseqalign) Simple visualizations of
  alignments of DNA or AA sequences as well as arbitrary strings.
  Compatible with Biostrings and ggplot2. The plots are fully
  customizable using ggplot2 modifiers such as theme().

- [HoloFoodR](/packages/HoloFoodR) Utility package to facilitate
  integration and analysis of EBI HoloFood data in R. This package
  streamlines access to the resource, allowing for direct loading of
  data into formats optimized for downstream analytics.

- [HuBMAPR](/packages/HuBMAPR) 'HuBMAP' provides an open, global
  bio-molecular atlas of the human body at the cellular level. The
  `datasets()`, `samples()`, `donors()`, `publications()`, and
  `collections()` functions retrieves the information for each of
  these entity types. `*_details()` are available for individual
  entries of each entity type. `*_derived()` are available for
  retrieving derived datasets or samples for individual entries of
  each entity type. Data files can be accessed using
  `files_globus_url()`.

- [immApex](/packages/immApex) A set of tools to build
  tensorflow/keras-based models in R from amino acid and nucleotide
  sequences focusing on adaptive immune receptors. The package
  includes pre-processing of sequences, unifying gene nomenclature
  usage, encoding sequences, and combining models. This package will
  serve as the basis of future immune receptor sequence
  functions/packages/models compatible with the scRepertoire
  ecosystem.

- [immunogenViewer](/packages/immunogenViewer) Plots protein
  properties and visualizes position of peptide immunogens within
  protein sequence. Allows evaluation of immunogens based on
  structural and functional annotations to infer suitability for
  antibody-based methods aiming to detect native proteins.

- [iSEEtree](/packages/iSEEtree) iSEEtree is an extension of iSEE for
  the TreeSummarizedExperiment. It leverages the functionality from
  the miaViz package for microbiome data visualisation to create
  panels that are specific for TreeSummarizedExperiment objects. Not
  surprisingly, it also depends on the generic panels from iSEE.

- [kmcut](/packages/kmcut) The purpose of the package is to identify
  prognostic biomarkers and an optimal numeric cutoff for each
  biomarker that can be used to stratify a group of test subjects
  (samples) into two sub-groups with significantly different survival
  (better vs. worse). The package was developed for the analysis of
  gene expression data, such as RNA-seq. However, it can be used with
  any quantitative variable that has a sufficiently large proportion
  of unique values.

- [koinar](/packages/koinar) A client to simplify fetching
  predictions from the Koina web service. Koina is a model repository
  enabling the remote execution of models. Predictions are generated
  as a response to HTTP/S requests, the standard protocol used for
  nearly all web traffic.

- [MetMashR](/packages/MetMashR) A package to merge, filter sort,
  organise and otherwise mash together metabolite annotation tables.
  Metabolite annotations can be imported from multiple sources
  (software) and combined using workflow steps based on S4 class
  templates derived from the `struct` package. Other modular workflow
  steps such as filtering, merging, splitting, normalisation and
  rest-api queries are included.

- [MOSClip](/packages/MOSClip) Topological pathway analysis tool able
  to integrate multi-omics data. It finds survival-associated modules
  or significant modules for two-class analysis. This tool have two
  main methods: pathway tests and module tests. The latter method
  allows the user to dig inside the pathways itself.

- [MPAC](/packages/MPAC) Multi-omic Pathway Analysis of Cancer
  (MPAC), integrates multi-omic data for understanding cancer
  mechanisms. It predicts novel patient groups with distinct pathway
  profiles as well as identifying key pathway proteins with potential
  clinical associations. From CNA and RNA-seq data, it determines
  genes’ DNA and RNA states (i.e., repressed, normal, or activated),
  which serve as the input for PARADIGM to calculate Inferred Pathway
  Levels (IPLs). It also permutes DNA and RNA states to create a
  background distribution to filter IPLs as a way to remove events
  observed by chance. It provides multiple methods for downstream
  analysis and visualization.

- [MsBackendMetaboLights](/packages/MsBackendMetaboLights)
  MetaboLights is one of the main public repositories for storage of
  metabolomics experiments, which includes analysis results as well
  as raw data. The MsBackendMetaboLights package provides
  functionality to retrieve and represent mass spectrometry (MS) data
  from MetaboLights. Data files are downloaded and cached locally
  avoiding repetitive downloads. MS data from metabolomics
  experiments can thus be directly and seamlessly integrated into
  R-based analysis workflows with the Spectra and
  MsBackendMetaboLights package.

- [OmicsMLRepoR](/packages/OmicsMLRepoR) This package provides
  functions to browse the harmonized metadata for large omics
  databases. This package also supports data navigation if the
  metadata incorporates ontology.

- [omXplore](/packages/omXplore) This package contains a collection
  of functions (written as shiny modules) for the visualisation and
  the statistical analysis of omics data. These plots can be
  displayed individually or embedded in a global Shiny module.
  Additionaly, it is possible to integrate third party modules to the
  main interface of the package omXplore.

- [PepSetTest](/packages/PepSetTest) Peptide Set Test (PepSetTest) is
  a peptide-centric strategy to infer differentially expressed
  proteins in LC-MS/MS proteomics data. This test detects coordinated
  changes in the expression of peptides originating from the same
  protein and compares these changes against the rest of the
  peptidome. Compared to traditional aggregation-based approaches,
  the peptide set test demonstrates improved statistical power, yet
  controlling the Type I error rate correctly in most cases. This
  test can be valuable for discovering novel biomarkers and
  prioritizing drug targets, especially when the direct application
  of statistical analysis to protein data fails to provide
  substantial insights.

- [Pirat](/packages/Pirat) Pirat enables the imputation of missing
  values (either MNARs or MCARs) in bottom-up LC-MS/MS proteomics
  data using a penalized maximum likelihood strategy. It does not
  require any parameter tuning, it models the instrument censorship
  from the data available. It accounts for sibling peptides
  correlations and it can leverage complementary transcriptomics
  measurements.

- [plyxp](/packages/plyxp) The package provides `rlang` data masks
  for the SummarizedExperiment class. The enables the evaluation of
  unquoted expression in different contexts of the
  SummarizedExperiment object with optional access to other contexts.
  The goal for `plyxp` is for evaluation to feel like a data.frame
  object without ever needing to unwind to a rectangular data.frame.

- [PolySTest](/packages/PolySTest) The complexity of high-throughput
  quantitative omics experiments often leads to low replicates
  numbers and many missing values. We implemented a new test to
  simultaneously consider missing values and quantitative changes,
  which we combined with well-performing statistical tests for high
  confidence detection of differentially regulated features. The
  package contains functions to run the test and to visualize the
  results.

- [PRONE](/packages/PRONE) High-throughput omics data are often
  affected by systematic biases introduced throughout all the steps
  of a clinical study, from sample collection to quantification.
  Normalization methods aim to adjust for these biases to make the
  actual biological signal more prominent. However, selecting an
  appropriate normalization method is challenging due to the wide
  range of available approaches. Therefore, a comparative evaluation
  of unnormalized and normalized data is essential in identifying an
  appropriate normalization strategy for a specific data set. This R
  package provides different functions for preprocessing,
  normalizing, and evaluating different normalization approaches.
  Furthermore, normalization methods can be evaluated on downstream
  steps, such as differential expression analysis and statistical
  enrichment analysis. Spike-in data sets with known ground truth and
  real-world data sets of biological experiments acquired by either
  tandem mass tag (TMT) or label-free quantification (LFQ) can be
  analyzed.

- [rhinotypeR](/packages/rhinotypeR) "rhinotypeR" is designed to
  automate the comparison of sequence data against prototype strains,
  streamlining the genotype assignment process. By implementing
  predefined pairwise distance thresholds, this package makes
  genotype assignment accessible to researchers and public health
  professionals. This tool enhances our epidemiological toolkit by
  enabling more efficient surveillance and analysis of rhinoviruses
  (RVs) and other viral pathogens with complex genomic landscapes.
  Additionally, "rhinotypeR" supports comprehensive visualization and
  analysis of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and amino acid
  substitutions, facilitating in-depth genetic and evolutionary
  studies.

- [scDiagnostics](/packages/scDiagnostics) The scDiagnostics package
  provides diagnostic plots to assess the quality of cell type
  assignments from single cell gene expression profiles. The
  implemented functionality allows to assess the reliability of cell
  type annotations, investigate gene expression patterns, and explore
  relationships between different cell types in query and reference
  datasets allowing users to detect potential misalignments between
  reference and query datasets. The package also provides
  visualization capabilities for diagnostics purposes.

- [scDotPlot](/packages/scDotPlot) Dot plots of single-cell RNA-seq
  data allow for an examination of the relationships between cell
  groupings (e.g. clusters) and marker gene expression. The scDotPlot
  package offers a unified approach to perform a hierarchical
  clustering analysis and add annotations to the columns and/or rows
  of a scRNA-seq dot plot. It works with SingleCellExperiment and
  Seurat objects as well as data frames.

- [scoup](/packages/scoup) An elaborate molecular evolutionary
  framework that facilitates straightforward simulation of codon
  genetic sequences subjected to different degrees and/or patterns of
  Darwinian selection. The model was built upon the fitness landscape
  paradigm of Sewall Wright, as popularised by the mutation-selection
  model of Halpern and Bruno. This enabled realistic evolutionary
  process of living organisms to be reproduced seamlessly. For
  example, an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck fitness update algorithm is
  incorporated herein. Consequently, otherwise complex biological
  processes, such as the effect of the interplay between genetic
  drift and mutation on the inference of diversifying selection, may
  now be investigated with minimal effort. Frequency-dependent and
  deterministic fitness landscape update techniques are also
  available.

- [scrapper](/packages/scrapper) Implements R bindings to C++ code
  for analyzing single-cell (expression) data, mostly from various
  libscran libraries. Each function performs an individual step in
  the single-cell analysis workflow, ranging from quality control to
  clustering and marker detection. It is mostly intended for other
  Bioconductor package developers to build more user-friendly
  end-to-end workflows.

- [seahtrue](/packages/seahtrue) Seahtrue organizes oxygen
  consumption and extracellular acidification analysis data from
  experiments performed on an XF analyzer into structured nested
  tibbles.This allows for detailed processing of raw data and
  advanced data visualization and statistics. Seahtrue introduces an
  open and reproducible way to analyze these XF experiments. It uses
  file paths to .xlsx files. These .xlsx files are supplied by the
  userand are generated by the user in the Wave software from Agilent
  from the assay result files (.asyr). The .xlsx file contains
  different sheets of important data for the experiment; 1. Assay
  Information - Details about how the experiment was set up. 2. Rate
  Data - Information about the OCR and ECAR rates. 3. Raw Data - The
  original raw data collected during the experiment. 4. Calibration
  Data - Data related to calibrating the instrument. Seahtrue focuses
  on getting the specific data needed for analysis. Once this data is
  extracted, it is prepared for calculations through preprocessing.
  To make sure everything is accurate, both the initial data and the
  preprocessed data go through thorough checks.

- [SpaNorm](/packages/SpaNorm) This package implements the spatially
  aware library size normalisation algorithm, SpaNorm. SpaNorm
  normalises out library size effects while retaining biology through
  the modelling of smooth functions for each effect. Normalisation is
  performed in a gene- and cell-/spot- specific manner, yielding
  library size adjusted data.

- [spatialSimGP](/packages/spatialSimGP) This packages simulates
  spatial transcriptomics data with the mean- variance relationship
  using a Gaussian Process model per gene.

- [SpectraQL](/packages/SpectraQL) The Mass Spec Query Language
  (MassQL) is a domain-specific language enabling to express a query
  and retrieve mass spectrometry (MS) data in a more natural and
  understandable way for MS users. It is inspired by SQL and is by
  design programming language agnostic. The SpectraQL package adds
  support for the MassQL query language to R, in particular to MS
  data represented by Spectra objects. Users can thus apply MassQL
  expressions to analyze and retrieve specific data from Spectra
  objects.

- [squallms](/packages/squallms) squallms is a Bioconductor R package
  that implements a "semi-labeled" approach to untargeted mass
  spectrometry data. It pulls in raw data from mass-spec files to
  calculate several metrics that are then used to label MS features
  in bulk as high or low quality. These metrics of peak quality are
  then passed to a simple logistic model that produces a
  fully-labeled dataset suitable for downstream analysis.

- [StabMap](/packages/StabMap) StabMap performs single cell mosaic
  data integration by first building a mosaic data topology, and for
  each reference dataset, traverses the topology to project and
  predict data onto a common embedding. Mosaic data should be
  provided in a list format, with all relevant features included in
  the data matrices within each list object. The output of stabMap is
  a joint low-dimensional embedding taking into account all available
  relevant features. Expression imputation can also be performed
  using the StabMap embedding and any of the original data matrices
  for given reference and query cell lists.

- [survClust](/packages/survClust) survClust is an outcome weighted
  integrative clustering algorithm used to classify multi-omic
  samples on their available time to event information. The resulting
  clusters are cross-validated to avoid over overfitting and output
  classification of samples that are molecularly distinct and
  clinically meaningful. It takes in binary (mutation) as well as
  continuous data (other omic types).

- [tidyFlowCore](/packages/tidyFlowCore) tidyFlowCore bridges the gap
  between flow cytometry analysis using the flowCore Bioconductor
  package and the tidy data principles advocated by the tidyverse. It
  provides a suite of dplyr-, ggplot2-, and tidyr-like verbs
  specifically designed for working with flowFrame and flowSet
  objects as if they were tibbles; however, your data remain flowCore
  data structures under this layer of abstraction. tidyFlowCore
  enables intuitive and streamlined analysis workflows that can
  leverage both the Bioconductor and tidyverse ecosystems for
  cytometry data.

- [tidysbml](/packages/tidysbml) Starting from one SBML file, it
  extracts information from each listOfCompartments, listOfSpecies
  and listOfReactions element by saving them into data frames. Each
  table provides one row for each entity (i.e. either compartment,
  species, reaction or speciesReference) and one set of columns for
  the attributes, one column for the content of the 'notes'
  subelement and one set of columns for the content of the
  'annotation' subelement.

- [tidytof](/packages/tidytof) This package implements an
  interactive, scientific analysis pipeline for high-dimensional
  cytometry data built using tidy data principles. It is specifically
  designed to play well with both the tidyverse and Bioconductor
  software ecosystems, with functionality for reading/writing data
  files, data cleaning, preprocessing, clustering, visualization,
  modeling, and other quality-of-life functions. tidytof implements a
  "grammar" of high-dimensional cytometry data analysis.

- [TMSig](/packages/TMSig) The TMSig package contains tools to
  prepare, analyze, and visualize named lists of sets, with an
  emphasis on molecular signatures (such as gene or kinase sets). It
  includes fast, memory efficient functions to construct sparse
  incidence and similarity matrices and filter, cluster, invert, and
  decompose sets. Additionally, bubble heatmaps can be created to
  visualize the results of any differential or molecular signatures
  analysis.

- [xenLite](/packages/xenLite) Define a relatively light class for
  managing Xenium data using Bioconductor.  Address use of parquet
  for coordinates, SpatialExperiment for assay and sample data.
  Address serialization and use of cloud storage.

- [zitools](/packages/zitools) zitools allows for zero inflated count
  data analysis by either using down-weighting of excess zeros or by
  replacing an appropriate proportion of excess zeros with NA.
  Through overloading frequently used statistical functions (such as
  mean, median, standard deviation), plotting functions (such as
  boxplots or heatmap) or differential abundance tests, it allows a
  wide range of downstream analyses for zero-inflated data in a less
  biased manner. This becomes applicable in the context of microbiome
  analyses, where the data is often overdispersed and zero-inflated,
  therefore making data analysis extremly challenging.

New Data Experiment Packages

NEWS from existing Software Packages
===================================

[alabaster.base](/packages/alabaster.base)
--------------

                        Changes in version 1.6.0                        

- Distinguish between scalars and length-1 vectors when
  saving/loading lists. This effectively unboxes all length-1
  vectors in a list, by default; this is probably the more
  reasonable expectation for other languages that have a concept
  of scalars. Users can override this by calling I() on elements
  that they want to keep as length-1 vectors, in the same manner
  as jsonlite.

- Streamlined the definition of the Rfc3339 class so that it
  behaves better with I().

- Normalize paths to resolve ~ prior to calling C++ code.

- Open HDF5 files in read-only mode to avoid permission-related
  problems for readObject()-dispatched functions.

- Store numbers at maximum precision when saving lists in the
  JSON format via saveObject().

- Added registerValidateObjectSatisfiesInterface() and
  registerValidateObjectDerivedFrom(), to allow developers to
  declare that custom subclasses satisfy an interface or have an
  inheritance relationship, respectively.

- Updated validateDirectory() so that it works with a directory
  of objects saved via saveObject(). Objects saved under the old
  regime (i.e., stageObject()) are auto-detected but can also be
  explicitly validated by setting legacy=FALSE.

- Added a data.frame method for saveObject(), to avoid fallback
  to the list method.

[alabaster.mae](/packages/alabaster.mae)
-------------

                        Changes in version 1.6.0                        

- Respect application-level overrides when saving child
  components of a MultiAssayExperiment.

[alabaster.matrix](/packages/alabaster.matrix)
----------------

                        Changes in version 1.6.0                        

- Support the SVT_SparseMatrix version 1 class definition in
  saveObject(). However, note that this was not implemented for
  the soft-deprecated writeSparseMatrix(), which now errors if
  such objects are passed in.

- Added a extract_sparse_array() method for the WrapperArraySeed
  class, for some future-proofing when the seeds eventually make
  the switch.

- Bugfix for integer overflow when saving large sparse matrices
  in saveObject().

- Open all HDF5 files in read-only mode for readObject() dispatch
  functions, to avoid permission-related issues.

- Added altReloadDelayedObject(), altStoreDelayedObject(), and
  their associated getters/setters, to allow applications to
  override the delayed operation saving/reading process.

- Added registerReloadDelayedObjectFunction() to allow extension
  developers to register reader functions for new classes.

- Added a ReloadedArray.reuse.files="relsymlink" option in the
  saveObject() method for ReloadedArrays. This creates relative
  symbolic links to the original array files, which is more
  robust to their movement provided the linked files are moved in
  the same manner.

- Enable deduplication of identical seeds across multiple calls
  to storeDelayedObject() within a single "session". This avoids
  making multiple copies of the same seed for different
  DelayedArray instances with the same seeds, e.g., in a
  SummarizedExperiment.

- Added an external.save.args= option to storeDelayedObject() to
  avoid conflicts in the method arguments of saveObject().

[alabaster.ranges](/packages/alabaster.ranges)
----------------

                        Changes in version 1.6.0                        

- Open HDF5 files in read-only mode to avoid permission-related
  problems for readObject()-dispatched functions.

- Use altSaveObject() when saving child components inside
  saveObject() methods.

[alabaster.se](/packages/alabaster.se)
------------

                        Changes in version 1.6.0

  readRangedSummarizedExperiment.

[alabaster.spatial](/packages/alabaster.spatial)
-----------------

                        Changes in version 1.6.0

- Switch to the latest Miniforge installer (24.3.0-0) by default.
  This is preconfigured to use the conda-forge channel and avoids
  issues with the non-FOSS licensing of the Anaconda
  repositories. Users can switch back to the old Miniconda
  installer by setting the BASILISK_USE_MINIFORGE=0 environment
  variable, but this will likely be deprecated in the next
  release.

- Channel specifications in the user's .condarc are now ignored.
  Only the channels by the developer in setupBasiliskEnv() (e.g.,
  via BasiliskEnvironment) will be respected, to improve the
  consistency of the constructed environments across devices.

[basilisk.utils](/packages/basilisk.utils)
--------------

                       Changes in version 1.18.0

- Moved all C++ libraries to the assorthead package. This uses
  the latest versions of the tatami framework.

- Automatically attempt to use beachmat.hdf5 (if installed) when
  encountering the various HDF5Array classes.

- Minor optimization when dealing with some known no-op matrices,
  e.g., WrapperArraySeed objects from alabaster.matrix.

- Map delayed type coercions from type<- to their corresponding
  native representations (or no-ops).

- Bugfix for initializeCpp() to work properly with dense Matrix
  instances.

- Soft-deprecated whichNonZero() in favor of SparseArray's new
  nzwhich() and nzvals() functions.

- Exported tatami.* utilities for manipulating
  already-initialized pointers from initializeCpp(). This
  includes all of the delayed operation wrappers, some previously
  internal functions for extracting matrix data, a new function
  for realizing the matrix into a standard R representation, and
  a new function for matrix multiplication.

[beachmat.hdf5](/packages/beachmat.hdf5)
-------------

                        Changes in version 1.4.0                        

- Migrated C++ libraries to the assorthead package. Also switch
  to the latest version fo the tatami_hdf5 library.

[BgeeDB](/packages/BgeeDB)
------

                        Changes in version 2.32                         

- Allows to download data from Bgee 15.2 with more bulk RNA-Seq
  and single-cell RNA-Seq

- Possibility to download h5ad single-cell data with the function

- Possibility to download integrated Bgee gene expression calls
  similar to Bgee gene page results with the function
  getIntegratedCalls

- topAnat has been optimized to run faster

[BiocGenerics](/packages/BiocGenerics)
------------

                       Changes in version 0.52.0                        

NEW FEATURES

- Define the OutOfMemoryObject class (VIRTUAL class with no slots).

- Add S4 generic containsOutOfMemoryData() and implement various
  methods.
  See '?containsOutOfMemoryData' for the details.

- Add S4 generic saveRDS() and a default method that is just a thin
  wrapper
  around base::saveRDS() that issues a warning if the object to
  serialize
  contains out-of-memory data.

[BiocNeighbors](/packages/BiocNeighbors)
-------------

                       Changes in version 1.99.0                        

- Switched to the new knncolle C++ libaries for all
  implementations. This greatly streamlines the internals and
  allows downstream packages to re-use the search indices in
  their own C++ code.

- Parallelization is now performed using the standard <thread>
  library.  This avoids the overhead of forking or starting new
  processes via BiocParallel.

- All *Index classes have been removed.  The output of
  buildIndex() is no longer guaranteed to be serializable, e.g.,
  external pointers to C++-owned objects; attempting to do so
  will raise a "null pointer to prebuilt index" error for all
  methods implemented in this package. The removal of this
  guarantee makes it easier to extend BiocNeighbors to new
  methods where the index structure does not have an obvious R
  representation.

- All functions (findKNN(), queryNeighbors(), etc.) will no
  longer coerce X to a matrix, to avoid the headache of S4
  dispatch ambiguity. Users should coerce their data into matrix
  format before supplying it to these functions.

- The last= option in findKNN() and queryKNN() has been replaced
  by the findDistance() and queryDistance() functions instead.
  This provides a much more intuitive method for the typical use
  of last=, i.e., to obtain the distance to the k-th nearest
  neighbor.

- findNeighbors() no longer reports each point as its own
  neighbor. Also, all neighbors are now sorted by increasing
  distance in findNeighbors() and queryNeighbors().

[BiocSingular](/packages/BiocSingular)
------------

                       Changes in version 1.22.0

USER VISIBLE CHANGES

- Several deprecated functions are now defunct.

BUG FIXES

- Results returned from BioMart queries will be read using Latin-1
  encounding
  if the default fails. Reported in
  https://support.bioconductor.org/p/9158844/
  (Backported to 2.60.1)

- Fixed issue when only one dataset was listed in a Mart instance,
  causing
  data.frame dimensions to be dropped.  This broke connectivity to
  https://parasite.wormbase.org. (Backported to 2.60.1)

[BioNAR](/packages/BioNAR)
------

  Extra arguments passed thru the ellipsis are forwarded to the
  internal
  calls to matchPattern().
  [by Aidan Lakshman <ahl27@pitt.edu>]

SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

- Undeprecate longestConsecutive().

- A warning in translate() has been elevated to an error because
  AA_ALPHABET is now enforced.
  [by Aidan Lakshman <ahl27@pitt.edu>]

- man/XStringSetList-class.Rd previously said that "DNAStringSetList
  and
  AAStringSetList are the only constructors", but the current version
  of
  Biostrings includes BStringSetList and RNAStringSetList constructors.
  This has been updated.
  [by Aidan Lakshman <ahl27@pitt.edu>]

BUG FIXES

- replaceAmbiguities() now checks to ensure input is DNA or RNA. This
  previously caused some odd behavior with AA input.
  [by Aidan Lakshman <ahl27@pitt.edu>]

- Fix bug in consensusMatrix() when input has length zero.
  [by Aidan Lakshman <ahl27@pitt.edu>]

- Get rid of spurious warning in readQualityScaledDNAStringSet().

                       Changes in version 2.12.0                        

BACKWARDS-INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES

- The range argument of the annotateCTSS function is renamed annot.
- The removeSingletons option of clustering methods is removed and
the
default value of keepSingletonsAbove is set to 0, which keeps the
standard behavior.
- In cluster objects, the dominant CTSS score is now stored in the
dominantCTSS object directly.
- The clusterCTSS function is replaced by the new paraclu and distclu
function. CTSS filtering is done beforehand with the new
filterLowExpCTSS function.
- Removed CTSSclusteringMethod() function and stop recording
clustering method name.
- Removed returnInterquantileWidth argument of functions and always
return that width when quantile information is provided. Closes #114
- The CTSStagCountDA function is removed.
- The dominant peak in TagClusters objects is now a GRanges object
like in ConsensusClusters.
- The custom method for tag clustering is removed. It was obsoleted
by
the newer CustomConsensusClusters function.
- The exportToTrack function now exports scores of tag clusters and
consensus clusters instead of setting them to zero.

NEW FEATURES

- Support the use of TxDB objects for annotating clusters.
- The plotReverseCumulatives() function now uses ggplot2. Its main,
legend, xlab, ylab, xlim and ylim arguments were removed as this can
be controlled via ggplot2 functions.
- New TSSlogo function wrapping the ggseqlogo package.
- New distclu and paraclu functions that can run directly on CTSS
objects. You can use them to test parameters before running the
whole CAGEexp object through clusterCTSS.

BUG FIXES

- CTSS filtering now works correctly with threshold = 0,
thresholdIsTpm = TRUE.
- The importPublicData function was repaired for FANTOM samples.
- Remove broken and obsolete customClusters method of clusterCTSS.
Use
CustomConsensusClusters() instead. Fixes #113.
- Ensure consensus clusters can be exported as tracks with
interquantile width information. Fixes #108, #70.

OTHER CHANGES

- Accelerated the computation of cumulative sums ~10×.
- Singleton filtering is now done by the paraclu and distclu
functions
themeselves; .ctss_summary_for_clusters does not change the input
clusters except for adding information.

Changes in version 1.9.5

- Add new extractByIndex() method.

Changes in version 1.9.4

- compound_tbl_lipidblast supports now parallel processing and
extracts more information from MoNA's JSON format (thanks to Prateek
Arora for contribution).

Changes in version 1.9.3

- compound_tbl_lipidblast: ensure exactmass is of type numeric.

Changes in version 1.9.2

- Allow CompDb to store that database name as alternative to an
active
database connection. This allows to serialize and load an object
to/from disk (serializing an active database connection would not be
possible) . Each call to extract data from the database will however
open (and close) its own connection.

[COTAN](/packages/COTAN)
-----

feature/add_condition_arguments_to_plot_functions Now the following
plot
functions take in conditions explicitly, instead of just instructions
to
determine them from the cells' names. The changes involved:
cellSizePlot(), ECDPlot(), genesSizePlot(),
mitochondrialPercentagePlot(), scatterPlot()

Added possibility to convert COTAN objects to/from
SingleCellExperiment
objects. SCE objects created by the Seurat package are supported

Hardened arguments' checks for function UMAPPlot()

Solved issue with the function establishGenesClusters(): it was
throwing
an error when one of the sub-lists in the groupMarkers argument did
contain only one element

                        Changes in version 2.5.7                        

Introduced new way to check for the Uniform-Transcript property of
the
clusters based on multiple thresholds calibrated so that the new
method
is more effective at describing really statistically uniform clusters

Functions cellsUniformClustering() and mergeUniformCellsClusters()
have
been re-factored so to support new class hierarchy for UT checkers.
This
allows user to select which method to use for the checks; as of now
the
following methods are supported:

- "SimpleGDIUniformityCheck"
- "AdvancedGDIUniformityCheck"

Avoided issue with pdf file creation: file handle was not closed in
case
of errors

Added possibility of choosing number of features in seuratHVG()

Solved minor issue with with clusterization functions in cases when
only
one cluster was created

                        Changes in version 2.5.6                        

Made function heatmapPlot() more easy to use and in line with the
rest
of the COTAN package

Now the method storeGDI() can take in the output data.frame from the
function calculateGDI()

Solved few minor issues with the vignette and changed a few default
parameters in cellsUMAPPlot(), pValueFromDEA() and
findClustersMarkers()

                        Changes in version 2.5.5                        

Stopped function cellsUniformClustering() from saving the internally
created Seurat object due to possibly long saving times

Split the now deprecated function getNormalizedData() into two
separated
functions: getNuNormData() and getLogNormData()

Re-factored function mergeUniformCellsClusters() to be more precise:
now
it merges clusters starting from the most similar in latest batch and
also runs the merging in multiple steps adjusting gradually the GDI
threshold ranging from a very strict up to the user given ones.

Fixed minor bugs in functions GDIPlot() and
clustersMarkersHeatmapPlot()

                        Changes in version 2.5.4                        

Added possibility to display UMAP plots of cells clusters, using the
function cellsUMAPPlot()

                        Changes in version 2.5.3                        

Updated the vignette to the most recent changes

Allowed user to set the ratio of genes above the threshold allowed in
a
Uniform Transcript cluster

                        Changes in version 2.5.2                        

Solved issue with usage checks about the torch library

Allowed user to explicitly opt-out from the torch library usage:
COTAN
will avoid torch commands when the option "COTAN.UseTorch" is set to
FALSE

                        Changes in version 2.5.1                        

Added support for the torch library to help with the heavy lifting
calculations of the genes' COEX matrix, with consequent substantial
speed-up, especially when a GPU is available on the system

                        Changes in version 2.5.0

[cydar](/packages/cydar)
-----

                       Changes in version 1.30.0                        

- Updated to use the latest BiocNeighbors, which means that the
  output of prepareCellData() is no longer serializable. This is
  because the precomputed index is now an external pointer to a
  C++-owned data structure, and cannot be moved between sessions.
  (Arguably, it was a mistake to expose these internals in the
  expected workflow for this package, but that ship has sailed.)
  Hopefully, this should not affect most users as they should be
  primarily interacting with the CyData object.

[DegCre](/packages/DegCre)
------

                        Changes in version 1.1.1                        

- Version up.

                     Changes in version 1.1.0.9000                      

NEW FEATURES

- runDegCre now accepts "qvalue" as an input to pAdjMethod which is
now the default. Our testing shows that this method improves the
performance of DegCre predictions. The qvalue calculation does not
require the user to specify a alphaVal.

- Added new function collapseDegCreToGene which converts DegCre
results for gene with multiple TSSs to use only the association that
spans the shortest distance.

- Added new function calcAssocProbOR that calculates the odds-ratio
for DegCre association probabilities. This function can operate on
assocProb or rawAssocProb values by altering the type flag. It is
meant to replace calcRawAssocProbOR.

- Added new function convDegCreResListToCreGeneScoreGR that converts
DegCre results to a simplified GRanges with the predicted gene and
score as metadata.

OTHER CHANGES

- Streamlined runDegCre code to use more subfunctions.

BUG FIXES

- Changed the internal function makePlotGInter to return a sorted
GInteractions to avoid inconsistent returns.

                        Changes in version 1.0.2                        

- Changed citation to Genome Research article

BUG FIXES

- Added parameter minNDegs to optimizeAlphaDegCre to stop it from
trying testedAlphaVals that result in the number of passing DEGs to
be too low for the optimization algorithm to function properly.

[DEGreport](/packages/DEGreport)
---------

                       Changes in version 1.41.1

------------

                       Changes in version 0.32.0                        

NEW FEATURES

- Add nzwhich() method for DelayedArray objects (block-processed).

- Support %*%, crossprod(), and tcrossprod() between DelayedMatrix and
  COO_SparseMatrix objects.

SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

- The default realize() method now returns an SVT_SparseArray object
  instead of an SparseArraySeed object when the array-like object to
  realize is sparse and 'BACKEND' is NULL.

- Coercing a DelayedArray object or derivative to SparseArray should be
  much more efficient (thanks to various tweaks that happened in the
  SparseArray and HDF5Array packages).

DEPRECATED AND DEFUNCT

- Deprecate SparseArraySeed objects.

- Deprecate OLD_extract_sparse_array() and read_sparse_block() generics
  and methods.

- Fix bug in coercion from DelayedArray to SparseArray when the object
  to
  coerce has NAs. See
  https://github.com/Bioconductor/HDF5Array/issues/61

[DelayedMatrixStats](/packages/DelayedMatrixStats)

and
missing data. Added messaging to previous functions reassign(),
reassign_jaccard() and reassign_balanced() to point towards
reassign_centroid(). Updated add_snps() function to add unfiltered
data.

[DepecheR](/packages/DepecheR)

[DESeq2](/packages/DESeq2)
------

                       Changes in version 1.45.1                        

- Dropping the requirement for DESeqDataSet to contain integers.
  This allows fitType="glmGamPoi" to be used. If non-integer
  counts are present and other fitType values are provided,
  the various functions will give an error, e.g. DESeq,
  estimateDispersions, nbinomWald, and nbinomLRT. To avoid
  integer conversion, use DESeqDataSet() with
  skipIntegerMode=TRUE. For more detail see:
  https://github.com/thelovelab/DESeq2/issues/66

[edgeR](/packages/edgeR)
-----

                 Changes in version 4.4.0 (2024-10-30)                  

- 
  New function catchRSEM() to read transcript-level
  quantifications from RSEM output. If the RSEM output includes
  resampling replicates, then catchRSEM() uses them to estimate
  the over-dispersion arising from read-to-transcript-ambuity for
  each transcript. Similar to catchSalmon() and catchKallisto()
  but for RSEM output.

- 
  New function normalizeBetweenArrays.DGEList() to apply
  microarray-style normalization to a DGEList by setting the
  offset matrix appropriately.

- 
  New argument `keep.unit.mat` for glmQLFit(). The unit matrices
  produced when 'legacy=FALSE` are not required for routine
  downstream analysis, so they are now not returned by glmQFit()
  unless `keep.unit.mat=TRUE`. This reduces the size of the
  glmQLFit fitted model object.

- 
  Output components var.prior and var.post from glmQLFit() have
  been renamed to s2.prior and s2.post.

- 
  glmQLFit() with `legacy=FALSE` now uses the improved empirical
  Bayes hyperparameter estimation in limma 3.61.9, which is
  designed especially for scenarios when the residual degrees of
  freedom are unequal between genes. Now that unequal residual df
  are better accounted for, very small df.residual values are no
  longer floored to zero before performing empirical Bayes
  estimation.

- 
  The default value of `top.proportion` in glmQLFit() with
  `legacy=FALSE` now depends on the number of genes and on the
  residual degrees of freedom, with more genes and more df giving
  smaller values. Also, the `DGEList` method for glmQLFit() with
  `legacy=FALSE` will take the dispersion from the mean of the
  right tail values of the trended dispersions, instead of
  re-estimating, if these are found in the `DGEList` object.

- 
  makeCompressedMatrix() now allows `x` to optionally be a row
  vector (matrix with one row) or a column vector (matrix with
  one column) or an ordinary vector. Previously, matrix values
  for `x` were simply returned as output.

- 
  diffSpliceDGE() now passes weights to glmFit.default(), if they
  exist.

- 
  A major revision has been undertaken to the C source code. C++
  has been removed in favor of pure C and, instead, the C
  functions are now wrapped into R in modern style. edgeR no
  longer depends on the Rcpp package. The new C code includes
  careful memory management and a simplified file structure.

- 
  Various edits to help pages. The edgeR publications in
  edgeR-package.Rd are now listed in reverse chronological order.
  Some help page cross-references have been fixed. The term
  "scalar" to indicate a numeric vector of length one has been
  replaced with "single value" in several places. The DGEGLM and
  glmFit help pages now clarify that the output `coefficients`
  component is on the natural log scale.

- 
  Add checks for negative or NA counts to cpm(), cpmByGroup() and
  normLibSizes().

- 
  Minor R code improvements that do not change the user interface
  to various functions, for example replacing any(is.na()) with
  anyNA() and using identical() when testing conditions within
  if() statements.

- 
  Remove decidetestsDGE(), whose functionality is now provided by
  the generic function decideTests().

[enrichplot](/packages/enrichplot)

[GeDi](/packages/GeDi)
----

                        Changes in version 1.2.0                        

- Smaller bug and typo fixes

- Fixed the bug that the getGenes() function would set all gene names
to all caps which lead to the inability to download the correct PPI
information for species like mouse. Also renamed the function to
prepareGenesetData() to reflect more accurately its behavior.

- Updated the default version used in the getId() and getStringDB()
to 12.0, the current version of the String database.

- Fixed the broken zoom feature in the Optional Filtering Step in the
Data Input panel. Additionally added a column Description to the
table of zoomed gene sets to facilitate interpretation.

- Fixed that the clustering will now be reset whenever a new score is
calculated.

- Updated the checkInclusion() function to drastically reduce
runtime.

- Fixed the error that the value of alpha would not be properly pass
to all the sub function used by the getpMMMatrix() function.

- Replaced all occurrences of PMM with pMM to match the notation of
the original publication.

- Replaced the kNN clustering algorithm with PAM (partitioning around
mendoids) as this seems to be more suitable for enrichment data
represented by distance scores.

- Renamed the goSimilarity() function to goDistance() to better
indicated that this is a distance rather than a similarity score.
Also scaled all scores to the [0, 1] interval.

- Fixed the normalization function in the getKappaDistanceMatrix()
function.

- Changed the implementation of the Louvain clustering algorithm to
use a weighted graph now. The graph is weighted by the distance
scores between gene sets.

- Added GeneTonicList as a possible input object for GeDi. Now GeDi
is
directly compatible with GeneTonic.

[GeneNetworkBuilder](/packages/GeneNetworkBuilder)
------------------

                       Changes in version 1.47.4                        

- Add nodeData parameter to polishNetwork function.

                       Changes in version 1.47.3                        

- Fix the duplicated parameters in polishNetwork function.

                       Changes in version 1.47.2                        

- Add cy3Network function.

                       Changes in version 1.47.1

[GeneTonic](/packages/GeneTonic)
---------

                       Changes in version 2.99.0                        

Other notes

- The transition to the functions available in the mosdef
Bioconductor
is complete, with the original functions now being deprecated. This
applies to goseqTable() (now replaced by mosdef::run_goseq()), which
has now been made faster and more robust in its functionality and in
the ways it can be executed
- The gene plot widgets now also use the gene_plot() function from
mosdef, instead of the previous ggplotCounts() function -
gene_plot() is more flexible and has more options to control the
behavior of the final plot object
- The deseqresult2tbl() and deseqresult2DEgenes() are now replaced by
the more flexible mosdef::deresult_to_df()
- The internally defined createLinkENS(), createLinkGeneSymbol(), and
createLinkGO() are now replaced by the equivalent functions in
mosdef
- The Roxygen-based documentation now supports markdown. No visible
changes should appear to the user, as the content should have stayed
fairly the same
- Although no visible changes for the end user are expected, the
incoming major version bump will reflect the change in the
dependency graph, ensuring that this is noticed at least at the
version numbering level

[GenomeInfoDb](/packages/GenomeInfoDb)

[GEOquery](/packages/GEOquery)
--------

                 Changes in version 2.99.0 (2024-10-01)                 

New Features

- RNAseq data support for GEOquery. Now you can use RNASeq
quantification data prepared by NCBI.

GEO
database using GEOquery.
- browseGEO() function to open a web browser with a GEO accession.

Breaking changes

- getGEO() now returns a list of SummarizedExperiment objects. This
is
a breaking change from previous versions of GEOquery. If you are
using GEOquery in a script, you will need to update your code to
reflect this change.

- Using httr2 instead of curl for better control over HTTP requests.
- Removed dead gunzip code.

[gg4way](/packages/gg4way)
------

[ggmanh](/packages/ggmanh)
------

                        Changes in version 1.10                         

New Feature

- Added a visualization that is an extension of manhattan plot called
binned manhattan plot. Instead of plotting each individual variant,
the variants are binned based on position (x-axis) and log10 p-value
(y-axis). More information can be found in the vignette.

- Preprocessing function is binned_manhattan_preprocess and plotting
function is binned_manhattan_plot.

Internal Changes

- Change the way positions of the variants are calculated. MPdata now
saves the unscaled positions and the scaling is done in
manhattan_plot function. (this is for the x-axis)

- To get the actual relative positions used in the manhattan plot,
use
calc_new_pos() on the MPdata object.

- Gap between chromosomes can be rescaled by using chr.gap.scaling=
argument inside manhattan_data_preprocess and manhattan_plot
functions.

- Now accounts for negative positions.

- layout argument can be a function to re-calculate the coord of
nodes
(2024-07-27, Sat, #622)
- layout.params = list(as.graph=TRUE) (by default) for converting
the tree to a graph tree (igraph object), so that graph layout
can be directly applied to visualize a tree
- otherwise, the function can assume the input tree as a phylo or
treedata object
- use yulab.utils::yulab_msg() for startup message (2024-07-26, Fri)
- mv %<+% operator to 'ggfun' (2024-05-28, Tue)

[goSorensen](/packages/goSorensen)
----------

                        Changes in version 1.7.0                        

We add the following function:

- enrichedIn: This function generates a binary matrix in which the
rows represent GO terms, and the columns represent lists. The matrix
uses the values TRUE or FALSE to indicate whether each GO term is
enriched or not for each list.

In addition:

- We have updated the buildEnrichedTable and allBuildEnrichedTable
functions. They now uses the outcomes of enrichedIn to build the
contingency table. During the conducted tests, the speed of the
procedure for generating contingency tables increased by a factor of
six compared to the previous version.

Furthermore, we have included the showEnrichedIn argument in these
functions. This is a boolean argument. If the argument is TRUE, in
addition to the enrichment contingency table, the function saves a
matrix in the global environment, which contains the cross table of
the enriched and non-enriched GO terms vs the names of the gene
lists generated with the enrichedIn function. This matrix is stored
under the name of "enrichedIn_" followed by the name of the ontology
and the level being analysed. An object will be produced for every
scenario if there are several levels and ontologies.

- We add the vignette "irrelevance-threshold_Matrix_Dissimilarities."
This vignette illustrates calculating, visualizing, and interpreting
the irrelevance-threshold matrix of dissimilarities D. This matrix
provides dissimilarities between pairs of compared lists. These
dissimilarities are not only a descriptive measure but also based on
the irrelevance threshold determining whether two lists are
equivalent. So, this dissimilarity measure between the two lists is
directly associated with their declaration of equivalence.

The matrix D can be represented in interpretable statistic graphs
such as dendrograms or biplots, which help to visualize the
formation of groups containing equivalent lists. Furthermore,
interpreting the biplot dimensions gives us the biological functions
responsible for the equivalence between lists.

[GRaNIE](/packages/GRaNIE)
------

                 Changes in version 1.9.7 (2024-09-25)                  

Bug fixes

- we made a few adjustments for the still experimental GC correction
feature in addConnections_TF_peak() that threw errors for some edge
cases when percBackground_size = 0

                 Changes in version 1.9.6 (2024-09-01)                  

New features

- we now support the mm39 mouse assembly. Please let us know if
something does not work. We are currently also generating the TFBS
resources for mm39, stay tuned. Once done, the links in the vignette
will work.

Improvements

- we now require patchwork version 1.2.0 and above, due to an
incompatibility reported between ggplot2 3.5 and patchwork versions
< 1.2.0. The error that may be thrown in
plotDiagnosticPlots_peakGene is this: Error in
Ops.data.frame(guide_loc, panel_loc) : ‘==’ only defined for
equally-sized data frames

                 Changes in version 1.9.5 (2024-09-01)                  

Improvements

- single-cell vignette update, made it clearer which settings to
change in the GRaNIE workflow for single-cell data
- warning messages now also contain the name of the function they
were
originally called from
- forcats warning for package versions of 1.0.0 and above fixed

                 Changes in version 1.9.4 (2024-08-01)                  

- changed default values for gene.types in filterGRNAndConnectGenes()
to all and adjusted documentation across functions that have also
this argument - by default, there is now no standard filter for the
gene type (genes were filtered to only protein-coding genes before
using protein_coding). This results in bigger eGRNs and seems more
sensible than to automatically filter genes for most use cases.

                 Changes in version 1.9.3 (2024-07-16)                  

Bug fixes

- fixed a bug that caused the peak-gene diagnostic plots to
incorrectly show background signal in plotDiagnosticPlots_peakGene()
(upper right plot on page 1). This was caused by not correctly
shuffling the RNA cunts data due to a code change that occurred in
version 1.7.4. We apologize for the confusion this may have caused.

              Changes in version 1.9.0-1.9.1 (2024-06-03)               

- version jump due to new Bioconductor development cycle

Improvements

- update for the single-cell vignette
- we now provide a public download for the HOCOMOCO v12 TF database
for both human (hg38) and mouse (mm10) that can be used as input for
GRaNIE in the addTFBS() function. We tested this database
extensively and use it as default TF database for our GRaNIE
networks.

  ranking of samples in the MST and the Anderson-Darling
  statistic.

- 
  New function RADtest is introduced. It implements a
  nonparametric multivariate test of variance based on the radial
  ranking of samples in the MST and the Anderson-Darling
  statistic.

- 
  New function CVMtest is introduced. It implements a
  nonparametric multivariate test of means based on the HDP
  ranking of samples in the MST and the Cramer-Von Mises
  statistic.

[GSVA](/packages/GSVA)
----

                        Changes in version 2.00                         

USER VISIBLE CHANGES

- Added a missing data policy for the GSVA and the ssGSEA methods by
  which missing values in the input expression data either propagate
  throughout calculations (use="everything"), prompt an error
  (use="all.obs"), or are discarded from calculations (use="na.rm").

- The readGMT() function now returns also a GeneSetCollection object,
  and can automatically identify the type of feature/gene identifier
  used in the GMT file, adding it to the metadata of the return object.

- Mapping between different types of feature/gene identifiers between
  gene sets and expression data has been improved.

- Added a new default for the kcdf parameter in the GSVA method,
  kcdf='auto', which tries to select the best value for this parameter,
  according to the input data.

- Added a new sparse regime of the GSVA algorithm, specifically
  tailored for expression data stored in sparse matrices, such as
  single-cell data, to address some of the shortcomings of the original
  (classical) algorithm with this type of data.

- Added two new methods, gsvaRanks() and gsvaScores(), to run the GSVA
  algorithm in two steps that provide additional flexibility to score
  gene sets and extract enrichment information.

- Added a new method gsvaEnrichment() to be used after gsvaRanks(),
  which allows one to extract enrichment information for a particular
  gene set and sample/column, including the possibility to produce an
  enrichment plot using base R or ggplot2 graphics.

- Package messages are now displayed using the cli package, changing
  and removing some of them, as well as adding other ones, to improve
  the information reported to the user.

BUG FIXES

- Removed API legacy convenience features, which keep causing problems,
  as per request of CRAN maintainers.

- Fixed some bugs in the shiny app.

[gypsum](/packages/gypsum)
------

                        Changes in version 1.2.0                        

- Switch to rappdirs to choose the cache directory. This allows
  re-use of the cache with the equivalent Python client.

- Improve handling of unexpected errors with non-JSON bodies.

- Added the unlockProject() utility for administrators.

- Renamed defineTextQuery() to gsc() (for "gypsum search clause")
  and generalized it to other fields in the SQLite file.
  Specifically, it now can filter based on the path to the
  metadata document, the project, asset or version names, the
  identity of the uploader and the timestamp of the upload.

- Added the translateTextQuery() function to convert a
  human-friendly search string into a gypsum.search.clause.

- Renamed searchMetadataText() to searchMetadata(), to reflect
  the more general nature of the search with the new gsc()
  function. The old name is now soft-deprecated.

- Renamed searchMetadataTextFilter() to searchMetadataFilter(),
  to reflect the more general nature of the search. The old name
  is now soft-deprecated. Added arguments to support custom
  names/aliases for the project, asset, version and path columns.
  Deprecated the capability for query= to accept character
  vectors, callers should supply a gypsum.search.clause directly.

[HDF5Array](/packages/HDF5Array)
---------

                       Changes in version 1.34.0                        

NEW FEATURES

- Add 'as.vector' argument to h5mread().

SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

- Improvements to coercions from CSC_H5SparseMatrixSeed,
  H5SparseMatrix,
  TENxMatrix, or H5ADMatrix to SparseArray:
  - should be significantly more efficient, thanks to various tweaks
  that
  happened in the SparseArray and Delayed5Array packages;
  - support coercing an object with more than 2^31 nonzero values.

- Coercion from any of the class above to a sparseMatrix derivative
  now fails early if object to coerce has >= 2^31 nonzero values.

- All *Seed classes in the package now extend the new OutOfMemoryObject
  class defined in BiocGenerics (virtual class with no slots).

BUG FIXES

- Fix long standing bug in t() methods for CSC_H5SparseMatrixSeed and
  CSR_H5SparseMatrixSeed objects.

- Replace internal calls to rhdf5::H5Fopen(), rhdf5::H5Dopen(), and
  rhdf5::H5Gopen(), with calls to new internal helpers .H5Fopen(),
  .H5Dopen(), and .H5Gopen(), respectively.
  See commit 31a7e06 for more information.

- the input of `hlaUniqueAllele()` can be a hlaAttrBagClass object or
  a hlaAttrBagObj object

- `hlaAlleleToVCF()` outputs 0 instead of NaN if the location of HLA
  gene
  is unknown or unspecified

Other notes

- The transition to the functions available in the mosdef
Bioconductor
is complete, with the original functions now being deprecated. This
applies to goseqTable() (now replaced by mosdef::run_goseq()), which
has now been made faster and more robust in its functionality and in
the ways it can be executed
- The gene plot widgets now also use the gene_plot() function from
mosdef, instead of the previous ggplotCounts() function -
gene_plot() is more flexible and has more options to control the
behavior of the final plot object
- The deseqresult2tbl() and deseqresult2DEgenes() are now replaced by
the more flexible mosdef::deresult_to_df()
- The internally defined createLinkENS(), createLinkGeneSymbol(), and
createLinkGO() are now replaced by the equivalent functions in
mosdef
- The Roxygen-based documentation now supports markdown. No visible
changes should appear to the user, as the content should have stayed
fairly the same
- Although no visible changes for the end user are expected, the
incoming major version bump will reflect the change in the
dependency graph, ensuring that this is noticed at least at the
version numbering level

[igvShiny](/packages/igvShiny)

- Version bump to rebuild classes derived from DotPlot.

[iSEEindex](/packages/iSEEindex)
---------

                        Changes in version 1.3.2                        

- Added a full implementation of the runr resource class, defining
its
behavior with simple heuristics based on the fact that users can now
also provide not just a path but the call to the command of R to be
run (therefore, the name runr) to obtain an object to explore. A
typical use case would be to deploy a collection of datasets from a
data package.

                        Changes in version 1.3.1

[lefser](/packages/lefser)
------

                       Changes in version 1.15.10                       

- [Major] Name of the two arguments for lefser function is changed
from groupCol and blockCol to classCol and subclassCol,
respectively.
- [Major] Defunct expr argument in lefser
- [New function] lefserPlotFeat plots the histogram of relative
abundance (in the (0,1) interval) of the selected features
- [New function] lefserPlotClad draws the cladogram of the
significantly more abundant taxa and their LDA scores
- [New function] lefserClades runs the lefser, returning additional
information (e.g., agglomerates the features abundance at different
taxonomic ranks) required for lefserPlotClad.
- [New feature] Visualization functions are using a color-blind
friendly color palette by default.

                       Changes in version 1.15.7                        

- [Major algorithm update] We remove the step (createUniqueValues) in
the lefser function, which used to add small random numbers to make
all the values unique. Potential issues (e.g., LDA) due to excess 0s
should be managed by filtering out low abundant features from the
input.

                       Changes in version 1.15.3

"scores") from c("Names", "scores")
- [New feature] The get_terminal_nodes function to select only the
terminal nodes of the hierarchical features (e.g., taxonomic data).
- [Major algorithm update] Add an option for adjusting the first
Kruskal-Wallis Rank Sum Test and Wilcoxon-Rank Sum test for multiple
hypothesis testing through the new argument method in the lefser
function.

[lemur](/packages/lemur)
-----

                         Changes in version 1.3                         

- lemur now automatically inserts the variables from the design
formula into the group_by argument for find_de_neighborhoods.
(thanks Katha for pushing for this feature)
- The formula parsing automatically detects global variables and adds
them to the colData. This avoids problems with the random test /
training assignment.
- Duplicate column names in colData are now longer allowed.
- Require harmony version >= 1.2.0 (thanks Maija for reporting the
problem)

[limma](/packages/limma)
-----

                       Changes in version 3.62.0                        

- 
  New function fitFDistUnequalDF1() for improved empirical Bayes
  hyperparameter estimation. The new function is an alternative
  to the long-standing limma functions fitFDist() and
  fitFDistRobustly().  The new function gives special attention
  to contexts where the df1 argument is unequal between cases or
  can include small fractional values, such as those resulting
  from edgeR's voomLmFit() or from the edgeR 4.0 quasi-likelihood
  pipeline.  The new function uses profile maximum likelihood
  instead of moment estimation to estimate df.prior, and so may
  be more accurate than fitFDist() or fitFDistRobustly() even
  when the df1 values are all equal. The new hyperpameter
  estimation will be used by default by eBayes(), treat() and
  squeezeVar() whenever the residual degrees of freedom are
  unequal, but users can request legacy behavior for those
  functions by setting `legacy=TRUE`.

- 
  New argument `adaptive.span` for voomWithQualityWeights() and
  normalizeCyclicLoess(), with the same purpose as the same
  argument for voom(). If `TRUE` then an optimal value for the
  span is chosen based on the number of genes in the dataset.
  voom() and voomWithQualityWeights() now return the chosen
  `span` as part of the output object if `adaptive.span=TRUE`.

- 
  contrasts.fit() now converts the coefficient name "(Intercept)"
  created automatically by model.matrix() to "Intercept", same as
  is done by makeContrasts(). This should avoid inconsistent
  coefficient names between the fitted model object and contrast
  matrices created by makeContrasts().

- 
  New argument `keep.EList` for voomaLmFit(), similar to the same
  argument for edgeR::voomLmFit(). The observation weights
  generated by voomaLmFit() are now stored only if
  `keep.EList=TRUE`.

- 
  voomaByGroup() now uses the overall mean-variance trend for
  groups with only one sample, for which a separate trend is not
  estimable.

- 
  Add Ravindra et al (2023) as a reference and Mengbo Li as an
  author to the voomaByGroup() help page.  Emphasize in the help
  details that only simple design matrices are supported by this
  function.

- 
  Revise the eBayes/treat help page to further clarify the
  `legacy` and `fc` arguments.

- 
  Bug fix to voomaByGroup() to save variance plot parameters
  correctly when `save.plot=TRUE`.

- 
  Remove argument `zero.weights` from the MArrayLM method for
  plotMD() and plotMA().

- 
  Fix bug in the MArrayLM methods for plotMD() and plotMA(),
  which were attempting to access a `weights` component of the
  fitted model object, analogously to what plotMD() does with the
  EList or MAList objects, even though MArrayLM objects do not
  contain a `weights` component.

- 
  Use of the stats package digamma() function replaced with
  statmod's logmdigamma() in fitFDist(), fitFDistUnequalDF1() and
  intraspotCorrelation().  Slight improvements to speed, accuracy
  and code simplicity, but results should remain the same to at
  least 13 significant figures.

-------------

                       Changes in version 1.13.7                        

Bug fix

- infer_eff_direction now includes A0 as an ambiguous case as well as
A1/A2.

New features

- eff_on_minor_alleles parameter added (off by default) - controls
whether MungeSumstats should assume that the effects are
majoritively measured on the minor alleles. Default is FALSE as this
is an assumption that won't be appropriate in all cases. However,
the benefit is that if we know the majority of SNPs have their
effects based on the minor alleles, we can catch cases where the
allele columns have been mislabelled.

                       Changes in version 1.13.6

Bug fix

- Bug fix for check 3 in infer effect column - previously A1 & A2
were
swapped when there were more matches for the ref genome in A1 rather
than A2 which was incorrect. Corrected now so it will only be
flipped when A2 has more matches to the reference genome.

                       Changes in version 1.13.2

[Rarr](/packages/Rarr)
----

                         Changes in version 1.5                         

- Fixed bug when creating an empty array with a floating datatype.
The
fill value would be interpreted as an integer by read_metadata() and
create and array of the wrong type.
- Fixed bug in update_zarr_array() when NULL was provided to one or
more dimensions in the index argument. This was parsed incorrectly
and the underlying zarr was not modified.
- Fixed bug in reading 64-bit integer arrays compressed with ZLIB or
LZ4.
The calculated decompression buffer size was too small and reading
would fail. (Thanks to Dan Auerbach for the report:
https://github.com/grimbough/Rarr/issues/10)
- Added support for the ZarrArray S4 class and the DelayedArray
framework.
- Improvements to read and write performance.

[rBLAST](/packages/rBLAST)
------

                 Changes in version 1.1.1 (2024-04-30)                  

Changes

- Added description of how to deal with multi-part databases.

- Fixed package anchors in man pages.

                        Changes in version 1.1.0                        

Changes

- makeblastDB() gained parameters db_name, hash_index and verbose.

- added has_blast() and made tests, man page code and vignette code
  conditional.

- added blast_db_cache() and blast_db_get() to manage downloading BLAST
  DBs
  using BiocFileCache.

[Rcpi](/packages/Rcpi)
----

                 Changes in version 1.41.3 (2024-09-09)                 

Improvements

- Added early dependency checks for pwalign in functions that use
pairwise alignment. If certain dependency conditions can't be met,
the error is raised immediately, preventing unnecessary computation
(#26).
- Replaced rjson with jsonlite to maintain compatibility with R
< 4.4.0. The recent rjson update (v0.2.22 , 2024-08-20) requires R
(>= 4.4.0), which would break builds on r-oldrel (#28).

                 Changes in version 1.41.2 (2024-08-30)                 

Improvements

- Since Bioconductor 3.19 and Biostrings 2.72.0, the pairwise
sequence
alignment facilities have been moved from Biostrings into the
pwalign package. For maximum compatibility, we now detect the
installed Biostrings version at runtime and decide which package to
use for pairwise alignment, without introducing pwalign as an
additional hard dependency.

When calling calcTwoProtSeqSim() and calcParProtSeqSim(), if users
have Biostrings >= 2.72.0 installed while pwalign is not installed,
expect to see an explicit error in the results saying that pwalign
is required and should be installed from Bioconductor.

                 Changes in version 1.41.1 (2024-07-20)                 

Improvements

- Replaced RCurl with httr2 and curl for retrieving molecular and
sequence data from web APIs. Updated the outdated API endpoint URLs
for DrugBank and RCSB PDB (#18).
- inst/CITATION now uses bibentry() to replace citEntry() (#19).
- Fixed check notes on lost braces when running R CMD check under
R 4.4.x (#21).

SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

- Remove warnings related to using coverage_matrix() or
expressed_regions() on Windows as rtracklayer::import() does work
with local BigWig files on that operating system. I'm not sure if it
will work with remote BigWig files given that remote BigWig file
access on other operating systems is not working due to
https://github.com/lawremi/rtracklayer/issues/83 and related issues.

[ResidualMatrix](/packages/ResidualMatrix)
--------------

                       Changes in version 1.16.0

  - subset_Array_by_Nindex()
  with default methods. Their purpose is to support subsetting (`[`)
  of Array derivatives and to make it easier for developers of Array
  extensions to implement subsetting for their objects.
  They are not intended to be used directly by the end user.

- Define low-level generics:
  - subassign_Array_by_logical_array()
  - subassign_Array_by_Lindex()
  - subassign_Array_by_Mindex()
  - subassign_Array_by_Nindex()
  with default methods. Their purpose is to support subassignment
  (`[<-`)
  of Array derivatives and to make it easier for developers of Array
  extensions to implement subassignment for their objects.
  They are not intended to be used directly by the end user.

SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

- read_block() now uses SparseArray::extract_sparse_array() instead of
  DelayedArray::OLD_extract_sparse_array() behind the scene to extract
  and load sparse blocks from a sparse array-like object. As a
  consequence,
  sparse blocks are now returned as SparseArray objects (implemented in
  the SparseArray package) instead of SparseArraySeed objects
  (implemented
  in the DelayedArray package).

[SingleR](/packages/SingleR)
-------

                        Changes in version 2.8.0                        

- Added the test.genes= argument to trainSingleR(), to restrict
  marker detection to only those genes in the test dataset. This
  is also checked against rownames(test) in classifySingleR() to
  ensure that the test's feature space is consistent with the
  space used during training.

- The introduction of test.genes= means that we no longer need to
  explicitly subset the rows of the reference dataset (to match
  the test features) in SingleR(). This saves memory by avoiding
  an unnecessary copy of the reference dataset, but may also
  slightly alter the marker selection as ties are broken in a
  different way. Namely, if the top X genes are used as markers,
  and the X-th and (X+1)-th gene have the same log-fold change,
  tie breaking will be based on the ordering of the rows in the
  reference matrix - which is no longer the same as in the
  previous version of SingleR. This results in some slight
  differences in the markers that propagate down to the
  classification results.

- Restored the BNPARAM= argument in trainSingleR(), to enable
  more fine-grained specification of neighbor search algorithms.
  The approximate= argument is deprecated.

- Soft-deprecated check.missing= in classifySingleR() and
  combineRecomputedResults(). This is because any filtering will
  cause a mismatch between the row names of tests and the
  test.genes in trained. Rather, filtering should be done prior
  to trainSingleR(), as is done in the main SingleR() function.

- combineRecomputedResults() now supports fine-tuning to resolve
  closely-related labels from different references. This is
  similar to the fine-tuning in classifySingleR() where the
  feature space is iterately redefined as the union of markers of
  labels with near-highest scores.

- Added the plotMarkerHeatmap() function to plot a diagnostic
  heatmap of the most interesting markers for each label.

- Added getPairwiseInteractingGenes which enables pairwise analysis
of
interacting patterns

                        Changes in version 1.1.1                        

- getSpatialFeatures: add default method to infer the object passed

it.

[SparseArray](/packages/SparseArray)
-----------

                        Changes in version 1.6.0                        

NEW FEATURES

- Linear subsetting of a SVT_SparseArray object e.g. svt[11:13].

- Add the 'dim' and 'dimnames' arguments to SVT_SparseArray()
  constructor
  function. Main use case is to make it easy and efficient to construct
  a zero-only SVT_SparseArray object of arbitrary dimensions.

- Add is_nonzero() generic with a default method and fast methods for
  SVT_SparseArray, COO_SparseArray, and sparseMatrix objects.

- The Sparse Vector Tree of a SVT_SparseArray can have "lacunar
  leaves",
  that is, leaves where the nzvals are missing. These leaves are
  semantically equivalent to leaves where all the values in nzvals are
  ones. This reduces the memory footprint of a "logical"
  SVT_SparseArray
  with no NAs by half.
  Note that a "logical" SVT_SparseMatrix object with no NAs is similar
  to an ngCMatrix object from the Matrix package. ngCMatrix objects
  don't store any non-zero values either (they're implicitly considered
  to be TRUEs), only their offsets.

- col/row summarization methods (a.k.a. "matrixStats methods") now work
  on COO_SparseArray objects (in addition to SVT_SparseArray objects).

- Add row/colSums2() and row/colMeans2() methods for SparseArray
  objects.

- rowsum(), crossprod(), tcrossprod(), and %*% methods now work on
  COO_SparseMatrix objects (in addition to SVT_SparseMatrix objects).

- Add fast colsum() methods for SparseMatrix and dgCMatrix objects.

- Add is.na(), is.nan(), and is.infinite() methods for SVT_SparseArray
  objects.

- Add pmin() and pmax() methods for SparseArray objects.

- aperm(<SVT_SparseArray>) now supports S4Arrays::aperm2() extended
  semantic. See '?S4Arrays::aperm2' for details.

- Add 'dimnames' argument to randomSparseArray(), poissonSparseArray(),
  randomSparseMatrix(), and poissonSparseMatrix().

- Coercions from dgTMatrix, lgTMatrix, or ngTMatrix, to
  COO_SparseMatrix/Array or SVT_SparseMatrix/Array, and vice versa.

- Coercions from ng[C|R|T]Matrix to COO_SparseMatrix, and vice versa.

- Coercion from ngCMatrix to SVT_SparseMatrix, and vice versa.

- NaArray objects: WORK-IN-PROGRESS! New objects that use the same
  internal representation as SVT_SparseArray objects (Sparse Vector
  Tree), but background value is NA instead of zero. See
  https://github.com/fmicompbio/footprintR/issues/7 for the
  motivating use case. They support most operations supported by
  SVT_SparseArray objects: [, [<-, t(), aperm(), cbind(), rbind(),
  abind(), matrixStats operations (col*(), row*()), etc...
  What's missing:
  - a dedicated vignette;
  - some row*() functions are not ready yet.

- Add new generics is_nonna(), nnacount(), nnawhich(), nnavals(), and
  `nnavals<-`(), with default methods and methods for NaArray objects.

SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

- Refactored subassignment of a SVT_SparseArray object, which resulted
  in significant speed improvement and memory footprint reduction.

- Speed up some row summarization methods (e.g. rowSums(x)) by
  implementing
  them natively in C rather than doing a transposition followed by a
  column
  summarization (e.g. colSums(t(x))). This avoids the costly
  transposition
  step which is very time and memory consuming.
  Row summarization methods with native C implementation so far:
  rowAnyNAs() (35x speedup), rowMins() (6x speedup), rowMaxs() (6x
  speedup),
  rowSums() (20x speedup), rowMeans() (18x speedup), rowVars() (5x
  speedup),
  and rowSds() (5x speedup).
  More methods will follow.

- Special-case 'lambda=0' in poissonSparseArray() so the empty
  SVT_SparseArray object gets returned instantaneously.

BUG FIXES

- Fix integer overflow in nzwhich() methods for CsparseMatrix and
  RsparseMatrix objects when the object has a length >= 2^31.

- Fix bug in coercion from COO_SparseMatrix to [d|l]gCMatrix or
  [d|l]gRMatrix when the 'nzcoo' slot of the COO_SparseMatrix object
  contains duplicates.

- Make sure that coercion from CsparseMatrix to SVT_SparseMatrix works
  on any [d|l|n]gCMatrix **derivative** and not just on a
  [d|l|n]gCMatrix
  **instance**.

------------

                        Changes in version 2.8.0                        

NEW FEATURES

- Allow incompatible data when combining objects `tsLib` and
  `tsSample`.
  The idea is if the column names of the `data` slots are different,
  the `c` operator do not fail. There are, however, limitations with
  some
  data types (like lists or matrices). If this is the case, then throw
  a more meaningful error message. (commit 6fb2f59)

BUG FIXES

- Fix `FAMEoutliers` manual grouping: The comparison should use
  character
  vectors instead of numeric. Also, an error was thrown due to an `if`
  condition not having an scalar return (due to using `is.na`).
  Note that since this version, the default values of startDay and
  endDay
  have been set as NULL. (commit 69e8a2f).

INTERNAL

- Add tests for `FAMEoutliers`.

                        Changes in version 2.6.2

New features

- The import method for h5 files now includes all rowData which
typically includes "ID", "Symbol", and "Type" columns.

Bug fixes and minor improvements

- rownames are set to first column in the features.tsv.gz data
(rownames for h5 files are determined by HDF5Array::TENxMatrix)
- TENxH5 now tests whether there is a /matrix/features/interval
dataset in the h5 file. It sets ranges to NA_character_ when
interval data is not found.

- Minor fix for as.data.frame= deprecation in tiledb_array().

- Support other datatypes for the dimensions and storage when
  configuring a TileDBRealizationSink. This is achieved via the
  new storagetype= and dimtype= arguments. Also added
  getTileDBDimType() and setTileDBDimType() to globally define
  the choice of dimension datatype.

- Bugfix to TileDBArraySeed to correctly handle dimension domains
  that do not start at 1. This requires a modification to the
  class to record the domain offset.

- Added a offset= option to TileDBRealizationSink() to create
  arrays with dimension domains that do not start at 1. This
  requires a modification to the associated class to record the
  domain offset.

[tomoseqr](/packages/tomoseqr)
--------

                 Changes in version 1.11.1 (2022-10-25)                 

- Made the following changes:
  o Added 3D visualize function to imageViewer
  o Changed `normCount` and `normMask` options in
  `estimate3dExpressions()`
  to `normalize` option. When it is `TRUE` (default), the function
  works as if
  `normCount = "count", normMask = TRUE`. When it is `FALSE`, the
  function works as if `normCount = "none", normMask = FALSE`.
